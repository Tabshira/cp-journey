# 💻 CP Journey

Hey there 👋  
This repo is a personal log of my Competitive Programming journey. I'm tracking everything from notes on algorithms to actual problem solutions.

## 📚 Folders

- `notes/` → Concept breakdowns (sieve, gcd, dp, etc.)
- `templates/` → Code snippets I reuse (Fast I/O etc.)
- `problems/` → Solutions to CP problems (mostly from Codeforces/AtCoder)
- `contests/` → Full contest files with rough ideas

---

### ✅ Goals
- [x] Start the repo
- [ ] Finish core algorithms
- [ ] Upsolve past CF contests
- [ ] Hit Specialist (and then Expert 🥲)

---

### ⚙️ Languages Used

- 💻 C++ for speed (and STL magic)
